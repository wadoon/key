</P>

<p>
RECODER is a Java framework for source code metaprogramming aimed to
deliver a sophisticated infrastructure for many kinds of Java analysis
and transformation tools.
</p>

<H3>Starters' Tour</H3>
<IMG SRC="doc/images/screenshot.jpg" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="right">
<P>
For a quick impression of RECODER's abilities, first browse a
<A HREF="doc/examples/converter-html/index.html" TARGET="_blank">generated HTML view</A>
of a small code example taken from Sun's tutorial, pretty printed and
annotated by RECODER. Note how well the syntactic structure is preserved.
You may also inspect the
<A HREF="doc/examples/src/application/XReferenceHTMLGenerator.java" TARGET="_blank">source of
the generator application</A>.
</P>
<P>
RECODER also allows to <EM>transform</EM> code. Another
<A HREF="doc/examples/src/application/Obfuscate.java" TARGET="_blank">toy program</A>
illustrates this. When applied to the example program, this obfuscator
produces a very interesting
<A HREF="doc/examples/converter-obfuscated-html/index.html" TARGET="_blank">result</A>.
Note that the modified program compiles and behaves as before.
</P>
<P>
These were just two of the <A HREF="doc/examples.html">example programs</A>.
If you are interested, feel free to <A HREF="doc/download.html">download</A>
a public release and run the examples on your machine - the screenshot
on the right shows a graphical demo application.

<H3>Features and Possibilities</H3>

<P>
The following table gives a
short description of the different layers of RECODER features as well as
the application perspectives that these layers offer:
</P>
<P>
<EM>Parsing and unparsing of Java sources</EM>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In addition to abstract model elements, RECODER also supports a highly
detailed syntactic model - no information is lost. Comments and
formatting information are retained. The pretty printer is
customizable and will be able to reproduce the code (possibly
improving upon it, but retaining given code structures) and to embed
new code seamlessly.
<P>
<I>Possible applications:</I>
Simple preprocessors, simple code generators,
source code beautification tools
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Name and type analysis for Java programs</EM>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
RECODER can infer types of expressions, evaluate compile-time constants,
resolve all kinds of references and maintain cross reference information.
</P>
<P>
<I>Possible applications:</I>
Software visualization tools, software metrics,
Lint-like semantic problem detection tools, design problem detection tools
(anti-patterns), cross-referencing tools
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<IMG SRC="doc/images/MetaprogrammingCycle-small.png" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="right">
<EM>Transformation of Java sources</EM>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
RECODER contains a library of small analyses, code snippet generators
and frequently used transformations.
</P>
<P>
<I>Possible applications:</I>
Preprocessors for language extensions, semantic macros,
aspect weavers, source code obfuscation tools, compilers
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Incremental analysis and transformation of Java sources</EM>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Transformations change the underlaying program model; for incremental and
iterative use, this model has to be updated accordingly.
Transformations have to take care of dependencies by updating their
local data and setting back matching positions when necessary;
however, RECODER will analyze change impacts for its model and perform
updates automatically.
</P>
<P>
<I>Possible applications:</I>
Source code optimization, refactoring tool,
software migration programs (Smart Patches),
design pattern, clich&eacute;s and idiom synthesis,
architectural connector synthesis,
adaptive programming environments,
invasive software composition

<H3>Restrictions</H3>
<P>
You can do marvellous things, but you cannot expect miracles.
A complete automation of software changes is far beyond todays
possibilities: In general, it is not possible to do reasonable design
decisions automatically, such as the choice of a fitting name for a
globally visible entity. Also, in general it is not possible to
analyze the behavior of <EM>reflective</EM> programs (analyzing reflection
requires value analysis which is computable in "easy" cases only). Therefore,
no guarantees can be given that the observable behavior of reflective
programs will be retained. Reflective programs are evil in that respect.
</P>
<P>
RECODER is already useful but it also still needs polishing.
The <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=28173&atid=392685">bug tracker</A> contains the currently known issues and the
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=392688&group_id=28173">feature
requests</A> tracker collects nice-to have features.

<h3>History</h3>
<IMG SRC="doc/images/UniLogo.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="right">
<P>
Development of COMPOST, the COMPOsition SysTem, started in 1998
following an idea of Uwe Aßmann. The core system was developped by
Andreas Ludwig as part of his PhD thesis, with a lot of help and
support from Uwe Aßmann and co-author Rainer Neumann at the <A
HREF="http://i44w3.info.uni-karlsruhe.de">software engineering and compiler
construction group</A> of Prof. Dr. Goos at the University of
Karlsruhe.  Since then, the number of users grew rapidly, mostly in
the "academic neighborhood".  In 2001, the core system of COMPOST was
made available separately as "RECODER" for a broader range of users.
