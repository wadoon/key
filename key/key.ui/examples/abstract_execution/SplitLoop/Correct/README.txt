A model of Martin Fowler's "Split Loop" refactoring. This is the currently biggest example in terms of proof size. It involves a loop and many Abstract Placeholder Statements. A loop in the original program performing two jobs at once is split into two sequential loops.

The example proof might take some time to load, and creating the proof (which comes with a proof script, so no manual interaction is required) will definitely take some time.
