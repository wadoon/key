example.name = List ADT with CASL
example.path = Upcoming ADTs
example.additionalFile.1 = reverse.casl
example.file = reverse-ref.key

Proof that reverse(reverse(list)) = list for any list (reverse is the inverse function for reverse).

This scenario is based on a ADT List based in CASL and demonstrates the use of CASL ADTs in Key.
