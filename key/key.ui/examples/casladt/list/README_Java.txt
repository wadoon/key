example.name = List ADT with CASL in JML
example.path = Upcoming ADTs
example.additionalFile.1 = reverse.casl
example.file = reverse.key

Demonstrate the use of ADTs inside JML specifications. This scenario is based on a ADT List based in CASL.
CASL can directly be include in KeY, and the generated definitons (sorts, functions etc.) can be used inside
JML via the escape sequence `\dl_XXX`.
