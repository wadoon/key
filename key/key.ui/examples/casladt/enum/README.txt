The shortest demonstration on how to use CASL in KeY.

The CASL files defines an ADT which consists of three
different values (EA, EB, EC) of sort Enum.

The problem states that every value of Enum is one of these three
values (constants).

This demonstrates the use of CASL in KeY by using "\include <file.casl>".

Requires two interactive steps: (1) allRight, (2) enum_ctor_split.
