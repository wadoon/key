/**
 * Formally, a test case is a tuple (m, I, Or), where:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>m</i> is the method being tested</li>
 * <li><i>I</i> is the input (Pi, Si) for the method. where Pi is a set of concrete parameter values
 * to the method (if the method accepts parameters), and Si is a state of the program holding before
 * the method starts execution.</li>
 * <li><i>Or</i> is the <i>Oracle</i> for the method being tested.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The Oracle is defined as a function Or(R, Sf) -> {pass, fail}, where:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>R</i> is the return value of the function when the method finishes executing</li>
 * <li><i>Sf</i> is the final state of the program after the method finishes executing</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Thus, less formally speaking, we can define the execution of a test case as a three-step process:
 * set up a program state to hoÄºd before the method executes, execute the method, and then verify
 * that the program is in a desired state after the method finishes executing.
