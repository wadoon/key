/**
 * Implementors of this interface represent KeYTestGen2 backend modules, i.e.
 * they represent test case generators for a specific test framework, making use
 * of the KeYTestGen2 runtime.
 * <p/>
 * The API supports the following basic modes of operation:
 * <ul>
 * Generate a test suite only for a subset case methods in a class.</li>
 * <li>
 * Generate a test suite for all methods in a class, with the option of
 * including protected, private and methods inherited from
 * <code>java.lang.Object</code>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * For any of the option above, the user has the option deciding the level of
 * code coverage to be provided, by supplying an instance of
 * {@link ICodeCoverageParser}. By default. Statement Coverage should be
 * targeted.
