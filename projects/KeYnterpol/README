This is SMTInterpol, an interpolating SMT-solver developed at the university
of Freiburg.  You can find more information on the website

1. Compilation
================================================================================

To compile SMTInterpol you need:
- Java (at least version 1.6)
- Apache ant

SMTInterpol comes with an ant build file that compiles the sources into a bin
folder (will be created by the build), and creates a standalone jar.


2. Usage
================================================================================

To run SMTInterpol from command line you need the standalone jar.  Run it as

java -jar smtinterpol.jar

and pass the necessary commands to the standard input of this process.
Alternatively you can specify a SMTLIB 2 script file as argument to the
process.  In either case, SMTInterpol will parse and execute commands until it
an exit command or the end of the input stream.


3. Integration into Eclipse
================================================================================

The source distribution of SMTInterpol is an Eclipse project.  If you want to
use this project, you can easily import it into Eclipse as "Existing Project
into Workspace".
